\chapter{Research Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item{\hypertarget{O1}{O1}: Understand the reasoning behind the observed distributions of different embedding types. Explaining both individual and relative results for \textit{E}-score models.}
    \item{\hypertarget{O2}{O2}: Understand what properties of embeddings help produce better cosine similarity and alignment results.}
    \item{\hypertarget{O3}{O3}: Understand why cosine similarity results primarily fall within a positive range.}
    \item{\hypertarget{O4}{O4}: Determine how models can be fine-tuned to improve \textit{E}-score method results.}
\end{itemize}
